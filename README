SOURCE CODE REPOSITORY FOR MESP
-------------------------------
(C) 2013 GewuIT.com. All rights reserved.

This is the code repo for Mesp cloud storage.

CLIENT
------

An example client is in test/ directory.
It is written in C, using POSIX networking API.

If you are running Linux:
    cd test/
    make
    ./cloudsto

There is currently no Windows port of the example client, but the networking functionality is well encapsulated in http.c. You can rewrite tcp_... functions to their Windows counterparts.

The cloudsto program is an interactive shell. Its code (cloudsto.c) can be reused to write a C program to be used in production.

The default IP and port of Mesp server is 127.0.0.1 and 8080. They are defined in macros MESP_SERVER and MESP_PORT in test/cloudsto.c, which can be easily changed.

A testing service have been provided (without third-party API checking):
    server: 202.38.95.74
    port: 8080

For more information about the API, read the comments in server code:
    cloudsto/views.py
The lines starting with "#" are comments.

SERVER
------

The server is written in Python using Django framework and Mongodb for persistent storage.

To run the server, you should install:
    python2
    python-django
    mongodb
    pymongo
    python-mongoengine

Start the server:
    python2 manage.py runserver
This will listen 8000 on localhost (127.0.0.1) on foreground.
In production environment, the server should be run in background.

To listen a different port (say, 8080):
    python2 manage.py runserver 8080

MongoDB schema:
    cloudsto/models.py
